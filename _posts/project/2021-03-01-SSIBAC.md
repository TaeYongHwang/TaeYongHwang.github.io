> In summary, the major contributions of this paper are:   
> - a novel SSI-based ACM called SSIBAC, with a focus on data privacy and sovereignty
> - an implementation of SSIBAC, relying on an attribute-based model
> - an evaluation of the implementation, providing insights on the bottlenecks of the solution and future research
> directions; the prototype processed 55,000 access controlrequests per second with a latency of 3 seconds.


# Centralized and Federated Identity (기존 로직)
- IAM(Identity Access Management)
- 내부 시스템에 의해 외부 사용자가 허가받는 방식

# Decentralized Identifiers
- 사용자가 중개자 없이 증명 가능한 방식

# SSIBAC
- 기존 ACM에서 블록체인과 SSI를 통합한 모델
- blockchain, decentralized identifiers, verifiable credentials 를 통해
- issuer의 신뢰도가 VC의 신뢰도에 직결 
- PEP, PDP, PIP, PRP?

> SSIBAC regulates the access of subjects to resources by evaluating access control
> rules against permission validators.

## Authentication and Access control with SSIBAC and ABAC

> To integrate decentralized identity with attribute-based access control, attributes need to be issued to a specific DID.
> This can be accomplished using VCs
